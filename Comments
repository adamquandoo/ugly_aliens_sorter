Open Points:
1. will the input file always be grouped by planets ?
   or the records might get shuffled as well ?
   
   I assumed that records might get shuffled. and I sorted the file before doing the transformation.
   So the result will not be same as given (given output file). My output file will be ordered by planets.
   
2. Tranformation logic
   Given transformation logic is not common for the 3 given planets.
   And if any new planets and aliens are coming new, what would be the trasformation logic ?
   
   It is quite difficult to write a dynamic code (only one function), for all the planets and aliens
   with different transformation logic.
   
   So, I assumed that thr transformation logic is same for all the planets.
   provided same transformation logic for all the records in the file.
   
   We should have a seperate function() for every transformation logic.
   And, then maintain a dictionary with mapping of (planets) <=> (transformation logic)
   
   We have to do some manual works in this case:
   (1) for every new transformation log, we need to add a code
   (2) for every new planets, we need to make an entry into the dictionary, 
        which transformation logic to be used for thie new planet.
        
        also need to mention a default transformation logic for planets.
